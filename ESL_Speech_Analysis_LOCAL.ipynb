They can be seen all the times, so they are very famous. And those people who are very rich and who have a really big company, they are also on the TV, on the news, so they are very famous as well.\n",

But now the people who are very famous just because only they are very rich and they act well and they do a really job about sports. So I think now we just focus more on the real things but not the things before. We just like the people who can do a great job but not to change the world now. Is that a problem? Well, I think now in this way somehow it can, you know, change the way of we see the world, especially to the children. They say just movie stars is good, sports stars is good, but they do not mind those scientists and maybe they just, in the future I just want to be a movie star and I just want to be a sports star. But if all the children will do that, we will act as a movie star, who will change our world, who will change, make our world better. So that's it.\n",
