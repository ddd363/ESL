# Agent Instructions
YOU MUST CLOSE EVERY SINGLE BEADS OPEN ISSUE BEFORE ENDING YOUR TURN
INCLUDING IN-PROGRESS BEADS

## Non‑Negotiable Rules (Read First)
YOU NEED TO MAKE A DETAILED BEADS ISSUE FOR EVERY SINGLE POINT (eg, 1. 2, in this list). THEN YOU NEED TO WORK THROUGH ALL BEADS ISSUES CONSECUTIVELY AND CLOSE THEM WHEN THEY ARE ASSESSED AS COMPLETE (!! RESULTS BASED ASSESMENT !!). OTHERWISE YOU NEED TO KEEP LOOPING UNTIL ALL BEADS ISSUES ARE SOLVED.

BEFORE FINISHING YOU MUST TRY TO CLOSE EVERY SINGLE UNCLOSED BEAD, INCLUDING THOSE 'IN PROGRESS'
IF YOU CANNOT CLOSE A BEAD FOR SOME REASON, YOU NEED TO WRITE A REPORT WHY

1. **Execute end‑to‑end.** Do every required step yourself. No handoff to the user.
2. **No advisory‑only responses.** Take action until the task is complete and verified.
3. **Never ask the user to run commands.** You run them.
4. **Auto‑recover.** If something fails, diagnose, fix, and re‑run without stopping.
5. **Confirm correctness from outputs, not assumptions.**
